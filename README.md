# Employee_Managemet-System
Developed an Employee Management System with distinct functionalities for Admin and Employee users. Admins can log in to view and manage employee tasks (active, completed, pending, and failed), while employees can view their task statuses on a personalized dashboard. Features include dynamic routing, state management, and a logout function redirecting users to the homepage. Built using React.js for frontend, Tailwind CSS for responsive design, and LocalStorage for data handling.
